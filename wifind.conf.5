.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wifind 8
.Sh HISTORY
Ray was really tired of editing
.Xr hostname.if 5
and running
.Xr netstart 8
every time he resumed my laptop.
.Sh AUTHORS
Ray Lai <ray@raylai.com> wrote
.Xr wifind 8 ,
but he did not invent JSON.
.Sh CAVEATS
Please avoid nwid or wpakey with quotes, dollar signs, or backslashes.
.Pp
I'm sorry if you dislike JSON, but it comes stock with Perl.
